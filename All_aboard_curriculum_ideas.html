<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I have written here about my ideas about the curriculum at Yonsho which I see as a central problem that needs addressing. Without a curriculum that is has clear, measurable goals and course content, it is impossible for teachers to even discuss issues of teaching methodology and lesson planning effectively.
</p>

<p>
The year one syllabus, and what I understand of years two and three, consists entirely of completing every activity in a textbook and weekly memorisation of words from the コーパス books. This is radically different from the way syllabi have been organised at any professional language schools I have worked at such at the British Council. I have written about the curriculum, teaching methodology, and assessment then provide some ideas about how this might be applied practically. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s quit long so feel free to skip to parts that might more useful to you such as the practical ideas section.

<h3 id="org57c1164"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Problems with the curriculum</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The biggest problem is a lack of a clear overall curriculum and syllabus for each year. I do not understand why there is not a clear national curriculum or a clear curriculum from Tokyo Metropolitan government.  The specific problem is that there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any clear information between the MEXT core standards documents and textbooks and so the textbook becomes the only way of organising the course for each year group. Without a syllabus for each year teachers rely on the textbook and the コーパス books to structure the course. New teachers have to rely on the set textbooks. Because of the pace they have very limited scope to incorporate extra materials of activities into their lessons. Unfortunately I think that despite the amount of work done the students are achieving very little quality language learning.
</p>

<p>
The key problems that I see with the materials are, firstly that the vocabulary that forms the regular tests from the コーパス books is too difficult and the way it is presented, as a series of out of contexts words to be memorised and tested against the Japanese definition, means that the words will not be retained in long term memory and certainly not incorporated into students&rsquo; working vocabulary. The vocabulary memorised for the tests does not provide any support for the surrounding lessons and is not reviewed or incorporated into grammar or skills activities. Secondly, the coursebooks on their own are not effective materials for these students. <i>All Aboard</i> is a lot better than <i>Viva!</i> but still has a lot of problems. The <i>All Aboard</i> grammar and functional goals sections seem more logical. Some of the texts in the early chapters such as <i>Breakfasts of the World</i> also seem useful. Other texts such as <i>Anne Frank</i> are beyond the students level. The vocabulary is not very useful and there are too few examples of the target grammar. The goal of understanding the whole of a text that is beyond the students level is not an effective use of time. The topics in each unit are based around specific themes, often around an aspect of Japanese culture. This often makes it difficult to relate to broad vocabulary groups or sets of language that fit naturally with the target grammar.
</p>

<p>
I have found it very difficult to find information on any English curriculum through the MEXT website (please let me know if you have any information). I have not been able to find a document for high school English but <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kB4CPF1NcZWhtQ_tuWETnVKAqi2fB9i6/view?usp=share_link">The National Curriculum Standards in Junior High School Section 9 Foreign Languages</a> provides an explanation as to why the textbooks are designed as they are. <i>Viva!</i> and <i>All Aboard</i> both appear to include all of the requirements in the guidelines. The various requirements in the document however, do not add up to a cohesive curriculum. These guidelines need to be linked to clear curriculum or syllabus guides that stand above, and guide, the textbooks. These guides would enable syllabi to be created that are independent of the textbooks and could be better adapted to students&rsquo; needs and task based, communicative teaching methods. An independent syllabus would also enable better assessment that is linked to standardised targets. If assessment is not independent from the course materials it is impossible to accurately assess whether students are learning effectively and whether the course materials are effective.

<h3 id="org1c8891a"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> CEFR</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The Common European Framework for Languages (CEFR) <a href="https://rm.coe.int/common-european-framework-of-reference-for-languages-learning-teaching/16809ea0d4">CEFR 2021</a> is a framework for organising European language curricula. This <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vZTjrAQZ6jJhpOQJLdMxh5eG9tvcF8l_/view?usp=share_link">CEFR assessment grid</a> gives an overview of the levels. All professional courses and materials I have used outside of the Japanese education system are linked to this and I believe that most universities in Japan have linked, or are being encouraged to link, their curricula to it. <a href="https://www.nier.go.jp/English/educationjapan/pdf/20210623-01.pdf">This document by Nakashima Takako in 2021</a> talks about the need and desire from MEXT to move to a curriculum based in the CEFR. However I cannot find any evidence of this being implimented in the curriculum.
</p>

<p>
The CEFR is used globally (although not the only system) to structure tests such as IELTS and Cambridge exams and the courses that lead to these. Because of this there are guides and lots of and materials based on it. Key aspects of the CEFR that I think should be adopted to create a curriculum at Yonsho and other Japanese high schools are firstly, that language is structured around functional goals that can be a assessed through <i>can do</i> statements. Secondly, there is a clear framework to assess levels and build syllabi that clearly defines, vocabulary, grammar, functions and skills for each level. We could therefore build a curriculum that would be stable over a number of years that could be improved year on year.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of how the CEFR is used. The <i>Cutting Edge</i> textbooks use the Global Scale of English that is linked to the CEFR. I have used it with adult learners in Japan. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v9ZdGuDtBtV_waFD3EpQSS1dZI01rMTX/view?usp=share_link">Cutting Edge Elementary reference map</a> hows how each unit is organised with <i>can-do</i> statements as targets and links everything to the CEFR. I would expect to see a  similar document in their high school English system with documents like this easily accessible for teachers, ALTs and JETs. In contrast to <i>Viva!</i> or <i>All Aboard</i>, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrL1OGTS5IIeECp9p2cJ4_zBwAzxPPvi/view?usp=share_link">Cutting Edge Elementary contents page</a> shows that the topics are based around clear, broad areas such as transport, food, shopping etc. This enables language to be presented in meaningful ways where sets of vocabulary are combined with structures to achieve meaningful functional goals.
</p>

<p>
I think that it would be possible to create a curriculum at Yonsho based on principles of the CEFR, even if it was not linked directly or in detail. This would free teachers from the textbook and enable teachers to design a course specifically for these students&rsquo; needs.  It would enable a stable curriculum to develop.  It would take effort to establish but it would mean that planning would become easier after the first year. Teachers could more easily share materials and develop the course each year. All teachers and students would know exactly what they were supposed to be doing and with proper assessment teachers would be able to assess students levels in relation to a global standard and be able to assess the effectiveness of the course.

<h3 id="orgf74d7d5"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Here are some ideas about language learning and teaching that I think are fundamental to teaching and learning using task based, communicative methods.
Most of these principles need to be applied at the syllabus level and used regularly to be effective. The year one syllabus this year makes it very difficult, if not impossible to follow some of the key principles.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7b1b0d7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7b1b0d7"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Scaffolding, sequencing of new language, repetition, and progression.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
&ldquo;Scaffolding&rdquo; is a key concept that is essential for communicative task-based teaching. This is the idea that previous knowledge structures or &ldquo;scaffolds&rdquo; new knowledge. &ldquo;Scaffolding&rdquo; can be language e.g. food vocabulary can structure the grammar &ldquo;I like&#x2026;&rdquo; It could also be images, gestures, or conceptual knowledge.
</p>

<p>
At lower levels the selection of what language to learn and when it is introduced is crucial because students have limited knowledge with which to scaffold new language. The sequence in which new language is introduced is crucial to enable it to be understood in the context of previous language without the need for translation to Japanese.  I taught at Morimura Gakuen shotoubu for six years where we taught six year olds from year one using no Japanese. This was possible by structuring the language and activities carefully.
</p>

<p>
We should use language that the students have learned previously and have some competence with and confidence in using to scaffold new language. This involves reviewing language that students have previously learned and thereby reinforcing language learning so that students can incorporate it into a working knowledge of the language so that they can use it, as well as identify its meaning.
</p>

<p>
A good syllabus would focus on the language that was important for structuring each stage of learning while also presenting language that does not need to be mastered immediately but can be returned to in future stages. For example when introducing food vocabulary for the first time to elementary first graders it was important that students were able to identify and use singular and plural nouns but not essential that they could memorise each food noun because they would encounter the words  again in later lessons.
</p>

<p>
To teach in an effective task based communicative way changes need to be applied consistently across the syllabus; if students spend most of their lessons listening to explanations of grammar in Japanese then it will not be possible to achieve productive one-off lessons that are conducted primarily in English.
</p>

<p>
A useful approach to scaffolding when planning lessons and activities comes from <a href="https://www.j-clil.com/english-clil">CLIL</a>. I have adapted it a little here but the idea is to consider each of the following aspects when planning and be careful not to teach more than one new aspect at any one time, thus using the other three parts as scaffolding.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Content language</b>: such as Vocabulary sets, grammar, e.g. food, tenses</li>
<li><b>Functional language</b>: Language used in the classroom by students and teachers to interact such as giving instructions, performing tasks and participating in groupwork.</li>
<li><b>Skills</b>: the four English skills: listening, speaking, reading, writing and also learning skills, group skill, specific presentations skills etc.</li>
<li><b>Subject content</b>: Usually set by the topics of each unit such as food, travel, sports.</li>
</ol>

<p>
By aiming to introduce only one new aspect at a time we can use the other three to scaffold what we want students to learn. We can think of the metaphor of a climber using handholds and footholds. She can change only one or two at the same time without falling off. Here is an example:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Introduce a pairwork activity by reviewing functional language in pairs and introducing any necessary functional language such as &ldquo;go ahead, your turn&#x2026;&rdquo;. Use vocabulary  (e.g. animals nouns) from the previous lesson.</li>
<li>Do the same activity with previously learned vocabulary and practice reviewing the functional language.</li>
<li>Introduce new vocabulary (e.g. adjectives to describe animals) to the activity.</li>
<li>Present reading or listening text using the vocabulary from the previous activity to introduce a new topic.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Another example would could be an extension of the picture description activity you did. I really liked the activity as a fluency activity trying to use language that they already know. After doing the activity once and students understand and are comfortable, I would repeated it as a grammar activity in the following sequence:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do the activity once to raise awareness of the function that they need, such as describing where objects are, but cannot do well because they lack a certain piece of language.</li>
<li>Give students some language input on prepositions of place and some structures e.g. A &#x2026;..is on/in/under/next to a&#x2026;..</li>
<li>Repeat the description activity using prepositions.</li>
<li>This could be repeated a few times focussing on producing more accurate sentences each time.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I like activities like this that create a need and desire in students to express a particular function and that shows them that they need a certain grammar of vocabulary input to enable them to do it. I think that doing this before introducing a language point increases students&rsquo; understanding of why they need to learn it and motivation to do so.
</p>

<p>
Sequencing of the four aspects is crucial. When planning a syllabus we should work backwards from our course aims, set as can-do statements, to establish what students will need to reach this and then work out the best sequence to introduce each part. We can then work on individual lessons.
</p>

<p>
A major problem with <i>All aboard</i> and <i>Viva!</i> is that the units do not present language or subject content in a way that enables scaffolding. A specific problem is that the textbooks do not provide clear sets of vocabulary that students can use to combine with grammar to achieve a function. We therefore need to introduce vocabulary in a more logical and easy to understand way that provides meaning through context and supports surrounding language learning goals such as grammar and skills.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtaullW1G1zxYut00ni_ePWsI1Y9uyhC944gyk-PZMs/edit?usp=share_link">These simple woksheets</a> I made for an elective class aim to present the target language in a way that enables students to achieve the goal of talking about their school day. My aim was to provide all of the language that students would need in a clear way that would enable them to progress by combining vocabulary sets with structures to produce a clear function.

<div id="outline-container-org5c773f3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5c773f3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Four skills.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The textbooks do not provide enough practise of the four main skills: reading, listening, writing, and speaking. I have seen skills addressed in other schools but mainly for test preparation rather than regularly integrated into lessons.
</p>

<p>
By identifying which specific skills we are focusing on in an activity, we can better use the materials. For example, we could use a text from <i>All Aboard</i> to read quickly for gist then for specific information. Students would therefore be able to use a text to practice a specific reading or listening skill without having to study language that was above their level and does not support the unit goal.
</p>

<p>
Texts could also be used for listening activities with specific skills goals that do not require complete understanding of everything in the text.
</p>

<p>
Assessment could include reading and listening skills work such as finding specif information or simple comprehension questions rather than knowledge of specific information from a unit.
</p>

<p>
New language should ideally be practised through all four skills, generally moving from receptive to productive skills.  We should expect students to be able to understand more than they can produce.

<h3 id="org01d5375"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Current issues with assessment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
My main concerns with assessment are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Assessment does not assess what students can do, only what they can remember from they chapters they have most recently studied.</li>
<li>Assessment is not related to any common standards or frameworks.</li>
<li>Speaking tests are not related to the written tests but rather test students&rsquo; ability to remember a script.</li>
<li>The course materials do not enable enough in-lesson assessment where teachers set tasks to assess where students are having difficulties and responding to this in the lesson or following lessons. Simple examples would be the asking students to produce the key aims of the previous lesson at the beginning of the following lesson to assess if students can produce the target language.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We therefore get little useful information about what each student can and cannot do, or whether our syllabus, teaching materials and methods are effective.

</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc52c65f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc52c65f"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> What information do we want from assessment?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Through assessment we need to gather information about the English level of new students, how individual student&rsquo;s are progressing, and the effectiveness of the course. We need to understand what each intake of students know and don&rsquo;t know; what they can and cannot do in English. It is clear that many students have not learned or retained many of the key points from junior high school. It is therefore necessary to establish what key areas need to be reviewed. We need to establish how individual students are progressing. This should be done against standards that are independent from the textbook and set by can-do statements. The progress should be made clear to students and form a key part of motivation and confidence building. We need to establish whether what and how were teaching is effective.

<div id="outline-container-org35c27b8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org35c27b8"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Assessment and syllabus planning should be done together</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Assessment and syllabus planning should be planned at the same time.  Functional goals in combination with language grammar, vocabulary. and the four skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) should be identified. We should be clear about what language output we expect students to be able to produce at the end of the syllabus. They should be able to show an understanding of the course content by producing spoken or written examples that achieve a specific functional goal. e.g. talking about their weekend.
</p>

<p>
The speaking tests we have done this term only assess the ability to remember the target language from a script that is not related to that term&rsquo;s course materials. It therefore assesses very little. The tests do have some value in that they provide each student with individual speaking time with the ALT / JET, they provide students with the opportunity to use English successfully and so improve confidence, and  they enable teachers to identify individual students who are struggling.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfff3e3a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfff3e3a"><span class="section-number-3">4.4.</span> Can-do statements should be used to organise goals and assessment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
The CEFR should guide assessment as part of curriculum planning. A crucial aspect of the CEFR is that it is structured on functional goals that are assessed with <i>can-do</i> statements. These include at least one of the four main language skills as well as language content. Our curriculum would look very different if it was structured by <i>can-do</i> statements. Our current goals seem to be that students can remember what they have studied in the textbook and can recognise some of it by translating to Japanese.
</p>

<p>
All Aboard does provide useful aims for each unit. Rather than do every part of each unit, we should ask ourselves how the texts and activities help students to achieve each of these goals; if there are better ways to get to the goal, we should use them instead of the book. Goals are laid out on p.146-147. These could be the foundation of any assessment. Following the textbook in way that involves translating every text will not enable students to achieve most of these targets by the end of term three. therefore, if we used these targets as our guide then we need to change the way we teach to achieve them.

<p>
The following examples of Cambridge speaking tests are graded by CEFR levels. I would like speaking tests at Yonsho to follow a similar interview style format. A quick look at these videos tells us that a syllabus for Yonsho students will not be higher than A2.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfzD1M5mKn8">A1 children&rsquo;s speaking test</a> It would be interesting to compare Yonsho students in a similar interview test. If Yonsho students could not do this then we need to ask ourselves why we are asking them to memorise B2 level vocabulary from コーパス.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DNilMthxx8&amp;t=318s">A2 schools speaking test</a> We should be aiming for this for most students by the end of year three.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NEhEyusaEs&amp;t=234s">B2 schools speaking test</a> This is the level that a lot of the vocabulary in コーパス 3000 is graded (it is in a pink box to the right of each word.). This is clearly too high for Yonsho students.

<h2 id="org840df77"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Practical ideas</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Here are some ideas of how these ideas could be practically used to develop a year one curriculum at Yonsho.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use goals set on p. 146-147 (in pink in the teachers copy) as the basis to create can do statements  then work backwards from these goals to identify what language and skills students will need to achieve them.</li>
<li>Assess students at the beginning of year one to identify what knowledge and skills students are missing from JHS and create materials and activities to remedy this at the begging of year one.</li>
<li>Create vocabulary materials that are appropriate for the students level and support other aspects of their language learning such as grammar and skills.</li>
<li>Create a wider variety of language input that is appropriate to their level.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Using the goals in p. 146-147 as a starting point, we could create a rough syllabus. If we left space for extra lessons then we could add more goals that teachers think are important such as areas that we identify from assessments at the begging of the year. We could submit a basic syllabus based on these goals to the school at the start of the year then refine each goal to add more specific language and skills goals as we create and teach the course.  We can then Identify what additional materials will be needed to support these goals and what sections of the book can be skipped.
</p>

<p>
There is a lack of good vocabulary materials that support the goals of the textbook. We would therefore need to create vocabulary materials that are appropriate for the students&rsquo; level and support other aspects of their language learning such as grammar and skills. We should focus on A1 vocabulary that should be organised in logical sets. This should be reinforced by regular repetition that should be part of the syllabus.
</p>

<p>
We should create a wider variety of language input that is appropriate to the students&rsquo; level. Most of <i>All Aboard</i> texts are too difficult for students and are not useful.  Students need a variety of comprehensible input (language that they can mostly understand) to constantly reinforce what they have learned and to scaffold new language.  It would be better to provide more material at lower a level as well as more challenging material but with specific language learing goals and activities.  For example identifying target grammar in a text without necessarily understanding every word.

I think that remembering vocabulary from the コーパス books has very little value because students do not learn the words in sufficient depth, that is, they only learn the form and meaning but not how to use the word in a sentence or how to combine the word with common combinations such as nouns with common prepositions, verbs and adjectives. Students will therefore forget most of what they have learned by the end of the term and will not incorporate much into their long term, functional vocabulary. Because these are set as tests, students prioritise them over other activities. Although some students may get a sense of achievement from completing the tests, I think that it is probably detrimental for students confidence and motivation to constantly be expected to remember language that is beyond their ability to assimilate.
</p>

<p>
In the コーパス books the levels are shown next to each word and we can see that about half the words are B1 or B2. The <a href="https://www.englishprofile.org/wordlists/evp">English Vocabulary Profile Online - British English</a> tool enables us to check a word&rsquo;s CEFR level. A quick check of keywords from <i>All Aboard</i> and <i>Viva!</i> show that many keywords are at least B1 level. If we check B1 against the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vZTjrAQZ6jJhpOQJLdMxh5eG9tvcF8l_/view?usp=share_link">CEFR assessment grid</a> and with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv_nEUnhFFE&amp;t=39s">this B1 seaking test video</a> video it is clear that this is too high for Yonsho students. Here is an example of keywords from chapter 10 in <i>All Aboard</i> where we can see that the level is well above the that of the students.

We can significantly improve on how we teach vocabulary by thinking about what vocabulary we introduce at each stage of the curriculum thinking about the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How does this vocabulary support the unit / chapter / lesson goals?</li>
<li>How is this language supported or scaffolded by previous language knowledge? Does it naturally fit with a particular grammar point e.g. <i>I like + food. I am + adjectives</i>?</li>
<li>How will this vocabulary scaffold / support future lessons?</li>
<li>How can we design activities that make students use new vocabulary in various ways that will improve their ability to use and retain new words?</li>
<li>What vocabulary is essential or important, and what language is not important that might be skipped or cut?</li>
<li>How will we review vocabulary?</li>
<li>How will we assess that students have learned the vocabulary?</li>
<li>Verbs are key to most of the key grammar points in <i>All Aboard</i> so we should carefully introduce verbs from the first lesson. We can us irregular verb tables for review and reference but we should also focus on a limited number of verbs in each unit and review regular and irregular verbs and present, past, participle and continuous forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think that the general structure of grammar points in All Aboard is good. This could be used as the basis for a curriculum with supplemental vocabulary, materials and activities added.
</p>

<p>
Topic lists taken from CEFR based materials should guide the choice of vocabulary. Here is list of vocabulary areas from the English vocabulary profile: animals, arts &amp; media, body and health, clothes, communication, crime, describing things, education, homes &amp; buildings, food &amp; drink, money, natural world, people: actions, people: appearance, people: personality, politics, relationships, shopping, sports and games, technology, travel, work.

<h3 id="org5f502da"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Ideas about All Aboard</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
I am very critical of the curriculum (doing every part of the textbook and the corpus book) . I think it will be very difficult for students to learn effectively following this curriculum although,  there may be ways to improve things a little by adapting it. I also think that it is very difficult to teach effective communicative task based lessons for individual lessons; some changes have to be implemented curriculum wide.
</p>

<p>
Although a lot better than <i>Viva!</i> the texts in All Aboard are still too difficult for these students. The necessity of understanding everything in each of the texts is a major problem. The texts do not review or build upon previous texts enough and introduce too many new words and structures so that students cannot read the text and infer the meaning of new language. A lot of the key words are not useful at this level and so will be quickly forgotten. The texts often do not clearly focus on the grammar point of the chapter or present clear sets of useful vocabulary.  For example the stated goal of lesson six is for students to talk about a picture but the textbook does not provide enough vocabulary input such as colours, shapes; prepositions of place, or nouns such as landscape features, to achieve this. The result is that a lot of Japanese has to be used to translate the text or a lot of time has to be spent setting up activities for relatively little return in terms of language learning. Students being continually presented with texts that are well beyond their level also seems to be very demotivating.
</p>

<p>
The subject content in <i>All Aboard</i> is better than <i>Viva!</i> but I have a lot of reservations. The major problem is that the subject content does not provide a structure that enables vocabulary sets that are organised around life areas such as food, family, hobbies, nature&#x2026;, to be combined with grammatical structures to enable students to achieve clear functional goals. If we look at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrL1OGTS5IIeECp9p2cJ4_zBwAzxPPvi/view?usp=share_link">Cutting Edge textbook</a> we see that each unit is based on an area that enables clear sets of vocabulary to be used.
</p>

<p>
Topic lists taken from CEFR based materials should guide the choice of vocabulary. Here is list of vocabulary areas from the English vocabulary profile: animals, arts &amp; media, body and health, clothes, communication, crime, describing things, education, homes &amp; buildings, food &amp; drink, money, natural world, people: actions, people: appearance, people: personality, politics, relationships, shopping, sports and games, technology, travel, work.
</p>

<p>
It looks as though textbook publishers are following MEXT core standards guidelines to include certain topics about Japan. Unfortunately this seems to have resulted in textbooks that have sacrificed language learning to government ideological ideas of national identity.

We need some assessment to find out what students have and haven&rsquo;t learned from JHS. This will guide remedial work. Key areas to check are: tenses, be verb, attitude / dispositions to English, and basic functions such as  introducing themselves and talking about likes and dislikes. The spoken assessment could be done informally in the classroom by the ALT. JET or JTE speaking to individual students at the back of the classroom and part of a personal introduction.
</p>

<p>
Primary aims of remedial / preparatory work will should include: be verb, confidence building, functional language to use in the classroom, and an introduction to basic communicative activities. <i>All Aboard</i> pre-lesson 1 and pre-lesson 2 could be integrated into this stage.

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think hobbies is a better vocabulary set than food to combine with the past tense because there are a limited number of verbs students can use with food. I would therefore combine or overlap Pre lesson 2 with p.20-25 of lesson one. I would build on adjectives to describe food on p.142 to make a link with the following.</li>
<li>I would create materials that presented hobbies and language to talk about hobbies to combine with p. 26-27.</li>
<li>There is lots of verb vocabulary to use with hobbies. It would be worth spending time on this so that students knowedge of verbs can scaffold work on tenses in following chapters. Key points would be:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>regular vs irregular verb forms</li>
<li>how to check verb forms for irregular verbs.</li>
<li>Verb changes for 1st, 2nd person.</li>
<li><i>play, do, go</i> for sports activities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spending time on these areas at this point would bring a lot of benefits.</li>
<li>It would be good to review family so that 2nd person verb forms can be practised.</li>
<li>countries review</li>
<li>Match food to countries.</li>
